This mode is faster and simpler to encrypt, resulting in QR codes with lower density and easier to transcribe. It is generally considered less secure than CBC because it does not provide data chaining, meaning identical plaintext blocks will produce identical ciphertext blocks, making it vulnerable to pattern analysis.
