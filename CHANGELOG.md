# Changelog 25.XX.X - XXX 2025

### New Device Support: Embed Fire
This device shares similarities with the WonderMV but stands out with its larger 2.4" touchscreen.

### New Device Support: WonderK PRO
From the wonderful land of Korea, a new creation arrives: the WonderK PRO. Created by an entrepreneur who loves the Krux project, the WonderK follows in the footsteps of the WonderMV, but boasts a larger 2.8" display! Computer simulator for the WonderK device is also included.


# Changelog 25.10.1 - October 2025

### Bugfix: Krux encrypted mnemonic as a passphrase is invalid, but no error was raised
Instead of displaying an error, the base43 encoded KEF Envelope was displayed and used as the passphrase - deriving the wrong wallet; since version 25.09.0
Solution: better error handling when decrypted data is invalid for the current context; error: "Failed to load".  Stricter validation to ensure passphrases are ASCII-only strings.

# Changelog 25.10.0 - October 2025

# Changelog 24.11.1 - November 2024

### Security Fix
This release addresses a vulnerability affecting AES-CBC encrypted mnemonics stored on flash storage, SD cards, and QR codes. Due to an implementation error, the Initialization Vector (IV) in our CBC encryption, which used camera-generated entropy, was not being correctly utilized, which meant it did not provide the intended additional entropy.


# Changelog 24.11.0 - November 2024

### Tamper Check Flash Hash and Tamper Check Code (Experimental)
The *Tamper Check Flash Hash* (TC Flash Hash) feature verifies the integrity of the device's flash memory by generating a unique tamper indicator that relies on hash properties. After setting up a *Tamper Check Code* (TC Code), this check can be performed at every boot or manually via `Tools -> Flash Tools`. The TC Code is a key component, required to execute the verification and detect unauthorized changes to the device's memory. Users can also fill unused memory blocks with camera-generated entropy to further mitigate tampering attempts.

### Flash Map
*Flash Map* is an auxiliary tool that allows users to visualize the regions of the device's memory that are empty. This helps users verify the results of actions such as:

- Wiping the device's memory
- Erasing the user's area
- Saving settings and encrypted mnemonics
- Filling empty blocks with camera-generated entropy

### Japanese Translation
Japanese translation has been added.

### BIP85: Allow Export Base64 Passwords
In  addition to BIP39 Mnemonics, users can now derive Base64 passwords from their keys. These passwords, which can be used in standard logins, can be noted down, saved to an SD card, or exported as a QR code.

### Vulnerability Fix: Block Import of Python Modules from SD Card
A feature of MicroPython, commonly used for general-purpose development, is the ability to run Python code directly from an SD card. However, with the recent implementation of tamper detection tools, this behavior is now considered a vulnerability. It was discovered that MicroPython would prioritize importing `.pyc` (Python frozen modules) from an SD card before checking the internal flash, which could be exploited to run unintended code from the SD card. To address this, a block has been implemented in MicroPython to prevent running any code from the SD card, enhancing the overall security of the device.

### Add Compatibility to Partial Text Mnemonic QR Codes
Partial Text Mnemonic QR Codes, like Coldcard's backups, where mnemonics words are cropped and contain only the first 3 or 4 letters, are now auto-completed and loaded.

### Multi-keypad Position Indicator
An indicator has been added to the bottom of keypads to help users identify the keypad index while swiping between them.

### WonderMV Simulator
Computer simulator for WonderMV device has been added.

### Krux Ethos
Guidelines have been created to assist with decision-making regarding the Krux project's interactions with contributors, users, and businesses that may create products or services related to Krux.

### Minor Bugfixes and Refactors
Several code improvements for better reliability and efficiency.

### Added Support for East Asian Languages - Korean and Simplified Chinese
After implementing low-level support for different glyph form factors, we were finally able to introduce the long-awaited Korean language translation. Simplified Chinese support followed shortly thereafter.

### Faster PSBT Scanning
Reduced the time required to scan larger PSBTs by optimizing processing speed.

### Improved QR Code Scanning
Enhanced scan success rates in challenging conditions, such as reduced focus or scanning from greater distances.

### UI Standardization
The positions of "Yes" and "No" in prompts have been inverted to standardize the UI. Affirmative actions, such as "Yes," "Go," and "Proceed," will now be positioned on the right, while "No," "Esc," and "Back" will be on the left.

### Enhanced Scanning Progress Bars
QR code progress bars now provide more detailed information. For UR PSBTs, the progress bar indicates when a valid frame is captured, while for BBQR, it displays the index or position of the last successfully scanned frame.

### Mnemoniocs Editor - Loading Mnemonics
When manually loading an existing mnemonic, you can now correct typos and mistakes during the review stage by simply tapping or navigating to the incorrect words. The checksum word will be highlighted in red if the entered mnemonic is invalid to help detect eventual problems.

### Mnemonics Editor - New Mnemonic
When generating new mnemonics through dice rolls or camera images, you can now modify the entropy by changing some of the mnemonic words. The final word will dynamically adjust to always produce a valid checksum.

### Support for Scanning Various Binary Grid Formats
In addition to TinySeed, the camera can now scan and load mnemonics from equivalent formats, such as OneKey KeyTag, or even generic binary grids, like spreadsheets with colored, squared cells.

### Message Signing Using SD cards
Recently released in Sparrow, the SD card message signing workflow is now supported.

### Generate Double Mnemonics from Camera
When generating a new mnemonic using the camera, users can now choose to create a "Double Mnemonic," in addition to the standard 12 and 24-word options. This feature generates a 24-word mnemonic that, when split in half, forms two valid 12-word mnemonics.

### Dice Rolls Pattern Detection
Krux warns the user if it suspects there are patterns within the actual rolls

### Optimized SD Card Signing
Better suited for large transactions, SD card signing is now more RAM efficient, allowing transactions with +100 inputs to be signed in less than a minute.

### Stand Alone Verifiable Signed PSBTs
As required in BIP174, signed PSBT QR codes and SD card files now contain all the required data to verify the signatures without needing the original, unsigned PSBT.

### Camera Optimizations for Yahboom (ver:1.1) With GC2145 Camera
Recent Yahboom K210 devices (ver:1.1) come with the GC2145 camera instead of the OV2640 (ver:1.0). Optimizations and features, such as anti-glare, have been added for the new camera.

# Version 22.08.2 - September 13, 2022

This patch release reverts the zpub QR code format, once again including key origin derivation info which is necessary for BlueWallet to use when preparing PSBTs for signing with single-key wallets.

It is recommended to update to this version if you are using a single-key "Imported Watch-only" wallet with BlueWallet and are seeing a "cannot sign" error message when trying to send an outgoing transaction. If so, please do the following:

1. Upgrade Krux to this new release
2. Delete the affected wallet in BlueWallet (funds are safu as long as you have your mnemonic)
3. Create a new wallet in BlueWallet by importing from the new zpub QR code that Krux now displays.
4. Open the wallet in BlueWallet and pull down to fetch the old wallet's transaction history.
5. Create a new outgoing transaction and scan the QR code with Krux.
6. Krux should display the tx information and allow you to sign.
7. Display the signed QR back to BlueWallet.
8. Broadcast!


# Version 22.08.1 - August 11, 2022

This release is to fix a bug that would have prevented Amigos from performing airgapped upgrades to the next release.


# Version 22.08.0 - August 10, 2022

This latest version of Krux is brought to you by @odudex, who tirelessly worked for months to get Krux working on three new devices: the Maix Amigo, Maix Bit, and Maix Dock. Thank you for all your hard work! 

Many other improvements to Krux were made along the way which will be listed below. 

Enjoy!

## Installing
For instructions on how to install this release, please follow the *Getting Started* guide on [https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

To perform an airgapped upgrade (with a microSD card) from a previous signed release, please follow the directions here: [https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-via-microsd-card](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-via-microsd-card)

## Changes
### ¡Three Amigos!
Krux now supports three new devices: Maix Amigo, Maix Bit, and Maix Dock. The Amigo is an all-in-one device with a touchscreen display, while the Dock and Bit are more DIY-focused kits where some assembly is required.
 
### New touchscreen UI + UX enhancements
Along with being usable on multiple devices now, Krux also has native touchscreen support and many refinements to its UI to make better use of the screen space it has. More work has gone into improving UX including the ability to escape out of the mnemonic loading or creation screens at any point.

### Built-in translations + Portuguese
Krux now includes translations in the firmware due to using a more space-efficient font format. With this change, the rendering issues with Vietnamese characters have also been fixed. A new Portuguese translation has been added.

### Amigo support added to Krux Simulator
The Krux Simulator, which lets you simulate on your PC what it would be like to run Krux on a device, was updated to support the Amigo. There is also now a PC option if you want to run Krux "natively" on your PC (**NOTE**: This is a toy for fun and is *not recommended* for real usage).

### CompactSeedQR support
Support for scanning SeedSigner’s newer "CompactSeedQR" QR codes

### BIP39 passphrases
Support has been added for BIP39 passphrases. After loading a mnemonic, you will be asked if you want to "Add a passphrase?" to it.

### Export signed PSBTs to microSD
You can now save a signed PSBT to microSD which should help users having trouble getting their webcams to read the tiny QR codes on the M5StickV. Furthermore, Krux supports loading a PSBT from microSD as well if you want to forgo QR codes entirely.

### Better mnemonic generation
The flow for entering rolls has been streamlined to allow more rapid input, with your string of rolls now being visible along the top of the screen as you go. We also introduced a change to how the D6 roll string is built, no longer including "-" between rolls prior to hashing to have consistency with ColdCard and SeedSigner. 

Note: We continue to use a "-" separator between D20 rolls to avoid reducing state space due to collisions (e.g., rolling 1-17 and 11-7 would result in the same 117 string without a separator, and would thus have the same hash)

### Back button and rotary encoders
All devices, even the M5StickV, support moving backward in the UI now. The left-side power button on the M5StickV no longer does one-press resets and instead acts as a third input button. Note: You can still shutdown the device by holding it down for 5 seconds.

Support for using a rotary encoder as the previous and next buttons has also been added. Check out @odudex’s open source case design with instructions on how to use one with the Dock:
[https://github.com/odudex/DockEncoderCase](https://github.com/odudex/DockEncoderCase)

Just to note, he also has a case design for the Bit:

[https://github.com/odudex/MaixBitCase](https://github.com/odudex/MaixBitCase)

### Updated website + i18n future
The Github Pages site has been updated with new documentation and screenshots for the Amigo.

A new internationalization (i18n) framework has been added by @qlrd that will allow the website to be easily translated to other languages so we can eventually have documentation for every language that Krux supports!

@qlrd is also working on a graphical installer we hope to start making use of in the future when it’s ready. Keep tabs on it here: [https://github.com/qlrd/krux-installer](https://github.com/qlrd/krux-installer)


# Version 22.03.0 - March 31, 2022
Finally, after much TODO, the first official release of Krux is out!

Krux will be following a calendar version release schedule similar to Ubuntu, hence the first release is version (20)22.03.0. If any glaring security issues or important bugfixes come up, they will make their way into point releases such as 22.03.1, 22.03.2, etc. All new work will go toward major releases which will get a new year and month combo.

Thank you to everyone who contributed their time and effort toward this release. It's been very cool to see people take an interest in the project! Also, a special thank you is due to @stepansnigirev for creating the embit library that Krux leans so heavily on.
