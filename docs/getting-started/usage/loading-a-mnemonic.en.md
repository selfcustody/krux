### Via Camera
You can choose to use the camera to scan a `QR code`, `Tinyseed`, `OneKey KeyTag` or a `Binary Grid`. Learn more about these [metal backups here](../features/tinyseed.en.md).

#### QR Code

It's unpleasant having to manually enter 12 or 24 words every time you want to use Krux. To remedy this you can instead use the device's camera to read a QR code containing the words. Krux will decode QR codes of four types:

- **Plain text QR**: The mnemonic words encoded as text, with words separated by spaces.
- [SeedQR](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/blob/dev/docs/seed_qr/README.md): Basically, it is the mnemonic words of the respective BIP39 numbers concatenated, encoded as text.
- [Compact SeedQR](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/blob/dev/docs/seed_qr/README.md/#compactseedqr-specification): Basically, it is the mnemonic words bits concatenated as bytes.
- [Encrypted Mnemonic](../features/encryption/encryption.md/#regarding-bip39-mnemonics): A specification created by Krux that encrypts the mnemonic words bits and adds some information about the encryption used.

After opening a wallet via one of the methods available you can use Krux to [backup the mnemonic](navigating-the-main-menu.md#backup-mnemonic) as QR code, [transcribe](../features/QR-transcript-tools.md) them to paper or metal using the transcription helpers or attach a thermal printer to your Krux and print out the mnemonic as QR. Check out the [printing section](../features/printing/printing.md) for more information.
You can also use [an offline QR code generator for this](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) (ideally on an airgapped device).

#### Tinyseed, OneKey KeyTag or Binary Grid
[Tinyseed](https://tinyseed.io/), [Onekey KeyTag](https://onekey.so/products/onekey-keytag/) and others directly encode a seed as binary, allowing for a very compact mnemonic storage. Krux devices have machine vision capabilities that allow users to scan these metal plates and instantly load mnemonics engraved on them (this feature is not available in [Krux Mobile Android app](../../faq.md#what-is-krux-mobile-android-app)).

To ensure a proper scan, place the backup plate over a black background and fill in the punched areas with black to enhance contrast. Alternatively, you can scan a [thermally printed version](../features/printing/printing.md) or a completed template. You can view some [examples of encoded mnemonics here](../features/tinyseed.md), and explore our [available transcription templates here](../templates/templates.md).

### Via Manual Input
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-manual-options-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-manual-options-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

Manually type `Words`, `Word Numbers`, `Tinyseed` (toggle the bits or punches) or [`Stackbit 1248`](https://stackbit.me/produto/stackbit-1248/).

<div style="clear: both"></div>

#### Words
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-via-text-word-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-via-text-word-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

Enter each word of your BIP39 mnemonic one at a time. Krux will disable impossible-to-reach letters as you type and will attempt to autocomplete your words to speed up the process.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

#### Word Numbers
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-via-numbers-word-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-via-numbers-word-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

##### Decimal
Enter each word of your BIP39 mnemonic as a number (1-2048) one at a time. You can use [this list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) for reference.

##### Hexadecimal and Octal
You can also enter your BIP39 mnemonic word's numbers (1-2048) in hexadecimal format, with values ranging from 0x1 to 0x800, or in octal format, with values ranging from 01 to 04000. This is useful with some metal plate backups that uses those formats.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

#### Tinyseed (Bits)
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-via-tinyseed-filled-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-via-tinyseed-filled-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

Enter the BIP39 mnemonic word's numbers (1-2048) in binary format, toggling necessary bits to recreate each of the word's respective number. The last word will have checksum bits dynamically toggled while you fill the bits.

**Tip**: You can use this screen to generate a mnemonic by flipping a coin:

- Flip a coin, if it is heads, mark the first space (value 1) of the word, if it is tails do nothing. Repeat this step for each space up to 1024 (if you flip 11 tails in a row, just leave the 2048 square marked).
- The last word has the checksum, you will do as you did with the other words, the only difference is that you cannot set some spaces, they are calculated automatically. For 12 words you will flip the coin only 7 times, for spaces 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024. For 24 words you will flip the coin only 3 times, for spaces 256, 512 and 1024.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

#### Stackbit 1248
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-via-stackbit-filled-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-via-stackbit-filled-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

Enter the BIP39 mnemonic word's numbers (1-2048) using the Stackbit 1248 metal plate backup method, where each of the four digits of the word's number is a sum of the numbers marked (punched) 1, 2, 4, or 8. For example, to enter the word "oyster", number 1268, you must punch (1)(2)(2,4)(8).

<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-storage-options-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

You can also retrieve [encrypted mnemonics previously stored](./navigating-the-main-menu.md/#encrypted) on device's internal memory or external (SD card). To load them you'll have to enter the same key you used to encrypt them.

## Confirm Wallet Setup
### Confirm Mnemonic Words
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-seq-mnemonic-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-seq-mnemonic-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

Once you have entered your mnemonic, you will be presented with the full list of words to confirm. A 12 word has only 4 checksum bits, so it has a 1 in 16 chance (6,25%) of still being valid even if you mistype a word. A 24 word phrase has 8 checksum bits, so it only has 1 in 256 chance (~0,4%) of still being valid if you mistype a word.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-seq-double-mnemonic-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-seq-double-mnemonic-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">
If you see an asterisk (`*`) in the header, it means this is a [double mnemonic](generating-a-mnemonic.md/#double-mnemonic).

<div style="clear: both"></div>

### (Optional) Edit Mnemonic
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-seq-mnemonic-edited-wrong-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-seq-mnemonic-edited-wrong-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

If you make a mistake while loading a mnemonic, you can easily edit it. Simply touch or navigate to the word you want to change and replace it. Edited words will be highlighted. If the final word contains an invalid checksum, it will appear in red. If your checksum word is red, please review your mnemonic carefully, as there may be an error.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

### Confirm Wallet Attributes
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/load-mnemonic-seq-overview-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/load-mnemonic-seq-overview-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

After confirming your mnemonic, a screen with an **information box at the top** with the wallet's attributes is shown. If they are as expected, just press `Load Wallet`. If you need to change something you may customize the wallet by setting a `Passphrase` or using the `Customize` button.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

#### The Attributes:

##### Fingerprint 
* :material-fingerprint: ` 73c5da0a `:
The [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) master wallet's fingerprint helps you make sure you entered the correct mnemonic and passphrase (optional) and will load the expected wallet. The fingerprint is the best checksum you can have, it's good to note it down.

##### Network 
* ` Mainnet `:
Check if you are loading a `Testnet` or `Mainnet` wallet.

##### Policy Type
* Check the wallet's policy type: `Single-sig`, `Multisig`, `Miniscript`, or `TR Miniscript` (Taproot).

##### Derivation Path
* :material-arrow-right-bottom: ` m/84h/0h/0h `:
The derivation path is a sequence of numbers, or "nodes", that define the script type, network, and account index of your wallet.
    * **Script Type** `84h`: The first number defines the script type. The default is `84h`, corresponding to a Native Segwit wallet. Other values include:
        * `44h` for Legacy
        * `49h` for Nested Segwit
        * `86h` for Taproot
        * `48h` for Multisig
    * **Network** `0h`: The second number defines the network:
        * `0h` for Mainnet
        * `1h` for Testnet
    * **Account Index** `0h`: The third number is the account index, with `0h` being the default.
    * **Additional**: For multisig wallets, a fourth node with the value `2h` is added to the derivation path.

    Default Miniscript derivation path is the same as for multisig: ` m/48'/0h/0h/2h `, but they can be fully customized

##### Passphrase
* ` No Passphrase `:
Informs if the wallet has a passphrase. Adding or changing the passphrase results in a completely different wallet and fingerprint.

### Customize Wallet
It is possible to change any of the **wallet's attributes** (it will be possible to change them later too, after loading). To load it faster next time, some default wallet attributes can be set in [settings](../settings.md), they are: `Network`, `Policy Type` and `Script Type`.

#### Passphrase
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/passphrase-load-options-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/passphrase-load-options-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

You can type or scan a BIP39 passphrase. When typing, swipe left :material-gesture-swipe-left: or right :material-gesture-swipe-right: to change keypads if your device has a touchscreen. You can also hold the button `PAGE` or `PREVIOUS` when navigating among letters while typing text to fast forward or backward. For scanning, you can also create a QR code from your offline passphrase using the [Datum tool](../features/tools.md/#datum-tool).

<div style="clear: both"></div>

#### Customize
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_m5stickv/wallet-customization-options-250.png" align="right" class="m5stickv">
<img src="../../../img/maixpy_amigo/wallet-customization-options-300.png" align="right" class="amigo">

This button opens a screen to change the `Network`, `Policy Type`, `Script Type`, and `Account` of the wallet. If `Policy Type` is Miniscript, you will be able to enter a custom derivation path.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

When everything looks good, press `Load Wallet`and you will go to the main menu...
