Krux is open-source Bitcoin signing firmware for devices with the K210 chipset.

Signing operations in Krux are done offline via QR code or via SD card. You can create/load your BIP-39 mnemonic, or import a wallet descriptor, and sign transactions all without having to plug the device into your computer (except to initially flash the firmware). It reads QR codes with its camera and outputs QR codes to its screen, or to paper via an optional [thermal printer attachment](../getting-started/features/printing.en.md). 

Krux does not come with its own desktop wallet software. Instead, you can use Krux with third-party wallet coordinators to create/manage wallets, and send transactions from your online computer or mobile device while keeping your keys offline. Krux was built to be vendor agnostic and works with many popular wallet coordinators, including:

- [Sparrow Wallet](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/)
- [Nunchuk](https://nunchuk.io/)
- [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/)
