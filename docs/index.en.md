Krux is open-source firmware that enables anyone to build their own Bitcoin signing device via off-the-shelf parts. It runs on Kendryte K210 devices such as the [Maix Amigo](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Sipeed-Maix-Amigo-p-4689.html), [M5StickV](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/m5stickv) and [more](parts.en.md)!, converting them into airgapped devices that can sign transactions for multisignature and single-signature wallets.

You can even attach a thermal printer and [print](getting-started/features/printing.en.md) out the QR codes that it generates.

To learn more about how Krux works, check out [Getting Started](getting-started/index.en.md).
