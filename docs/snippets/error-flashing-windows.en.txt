On Windows, you may encounter the **flash failed** error when trying to flash Yahboom or WonderMV using **Krux-Installer**. This means that Windows could not find the driver to communicate with the device via USB (an unrecognized *USB Serial* will be listed in *Device Manager -> Other devices*). To fix this, download and install the [CH340/341 driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/ch341ser_exe.html) (a *USB-SERIAL CH340* will be listed in *Device Manager -> Ports (COM & LPT)*).

**Extra note about WonderMV**: Some units seem to have quality-control issues affecting their capacitors, leaving the device stuck in a state where firmware flashing consistently fails. To resolve this, unplug the USB cable, wait at least 10 seconds, and then plug it back in before attempting to flash again.
